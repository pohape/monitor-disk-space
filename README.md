# monitor_disk_space
The script is designed to monitor disk usage on a specified disk device and alert you via email when the usage exceeds a set threshold. It uses Mailgun's API for email notifications, making it suitable for system administrators who need to keep an eye on server disk space to prevent outages or performance degradation due to disk full issues.
